Hackemon —

Essentially our game will be broken down into two main functionalities, “explore” mode and “duel” mode. 

Explore mode will be somewhat of a mixture of Pokémon and Pac-Man. We originally wanted to have a “hero” character that can explore the game-board looking for hidden “skills” and could enter new areas of the map. But we determined that that would be too difficult. So, enter the influence of Pac-Man. We decided that we will have the player moving around a set Maze like path, trying to reach the “skills” before the “enemy” can catch up to you. So you’ll have to strategically traverse the path similar to Pac-Man . If the “hero” gets caught before collecting the necessary “skills”, they’ll automatically lose because they don’t have the power to enter the duel. Once the player collects enough “skills” to enter the duel they will enter a Pokémon style battle, where they’ll have to choose the right “attacks” to maximize their score in that level.
